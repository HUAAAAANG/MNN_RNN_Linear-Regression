# MNN_RNN_Exo

Here are two supervised learning mini-projects. One is to infer the fuel consumption of a car from its model, number of engine cylinders, and other parameters; the other is to infer the electricity consumption of the day based on the temperature, recommended retail price (RRP) of electricity, and other parameters. It is worth noting that the second mini-project takes into account the time dimension, i.e., the effect of daily electricity consumption in the past certain days on the predicted value of the current day's electricity consumption.

In this repository:
1. The folder "MNN" contains the main script for first mini-project. The model is multi-layer neural network with SGD optimizer.
2. The folder "RNN" contains the main script for second mini-ptoject. The model is RNN or LSTM with Adam optimizer.
